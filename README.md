A simple website to help you choose F-Droid apps by adding external data to an easily-searchable HTML table.

## Motivation

F-Droid is the best app store to find FOSS Android apps.

It allows thousands of independent developers to freely publish their apps and making them available to the general public.

By only relying on donation to sustain their infrastructure you will see no ads, no premium features and no sponsored apps.

They also don't track their users. But as we can't know how many times an app has been downloaded, by not knowing the popularity of an app it can be difficult to choose between several choices.

The idea behind this repository is to look at external metrics to help choosing popular and well-maintained F-Droid apps.
